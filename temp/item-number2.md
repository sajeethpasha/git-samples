**API Documentation for Management Review**  
*List Organization Codes by Item Number*

---

### **1. Overview**  
This API retrieves a list of valid organization codes associated with a specific item, excluding predefined non-relevant organizations. It ensures only organizations with valid types are returned, supporting downstream business processes like inventory management.

---

### **2. API Endpoint Details**  
- **Endpoint**: `GET /{item-number}/organizations`  
  - Example: `/ITM-12345/organizations`  
- **Response**:  
  - `200 OK`: Returns a list of organization codes (e.g., `["ORG_A", "ORG_B"]`).  
  - `404 Not Found`: Returned if no valid organizations are linked to the item.  

---

### **3. Key Features & Logic**  
#### **Filtering Logic**  
1. **Exclude "MST" Organizations**:  
   - Automatically skips organizations with the code `MST` during initial data fetch.  
2. **Validation-Type Exclusion**:  
   - Organizations classified as `VALIDATION` type are filtered out to avoid non-operational entities.  

#### **Data Flow**  
1. **Fetch Item Data**:  
   - Retrieve item details using the provided `item-number`.  
2. **Fetch Organization Metadata**:  
   - For each item, call an external service to fetch its organization type.  
3. **Filter & Compile Results**:  
   - Return only organizations with valid types, excluding `VALIDATION`.  

---

### **4. Error Handling**  
- **External Service Errors**:  
  - Failures in fetching organization types (e.g., timeouts, invalid IDs) are gracefully ignored, ensuring partial data is still returned where possible.  
- **Client Errors**:  
  - Invalid requests (e.g., malformed `item-number`) trigger a `404 Not Found` response.  

---

### **5. Dependencies**  
1. **External Service: Organization Type Lookup**  
   - **Endpoint**: `GET /organizations/{organizationId}`  
   - **Purpose**: Fetches metadata (including `organizationType`) for validation.  
   - **Authentication**: Uses Azure authentication tokens for secure access.  

---

### **6. Notes for Stakeholders**  
- **Performance**: The API processes items sequentially; large datasets may require optimization.  
- **Logging**: Critical steps (e.g., final responses, external service errors) are logged for auditability.  
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle moderate request volumes; monitor usage as adoption grows.

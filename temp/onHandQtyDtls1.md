# Inventory Onhand Quantity Details API - Management Overview

## Executive Summary

This document explains a key component of our inventory management system: the "Get Onhand Quantity Details" functionality. This feature provides real-time visibility into inventory quantities across our organization, with detailed information about what items are available, where they are located, and their availability status.

## Business Purpose

This API endpoint answers critical inventory questions:
- "How much of a specific item do we have on hand?"
- "Where exactly is this inventory located within our facilities?"
- "How much of this inventory is available for transactions or reservations?"

This information is essential for:
- Order fulfillment decisions
- Inventory planning and replenishment
- Warehouse management
- Supply chain optimization

## Key Functionality

When a user queries for inventory onhand details, the system:

1. Searches for inventory based on provided parameters:
   - Organization code (required)
   - Subinventory code (optional)
   - Item number (optional)

2. Retrieves comprehensive inventory information including:
   - Organization and subinventory locations
   - Item details
   - Lot numbers
   - Storage locators
   - Quantity information

3. Enriches the data with critical availability metrics:
   - Total onhand quantity
   - Quantity available to transact
   - Quantity available to reserve

## Data Flow and Integration

The system operates through a multi-step process to ensure accurate and complete information:

1. Initial query to our business intelligence system for base inventory data
2. Enrichment with real-time availability data from our core inventory system
3. Data transformation and formatting for consistency (e.g., standardizing locator formats)
4. Comprehensive error handling to ensure reliable service

## Business Rules Applied

The implementation enforces several important business practices:
1. Security through Azure token authentication
2. Input sanitization to prevent security issues

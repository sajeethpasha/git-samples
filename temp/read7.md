Below is a simple, step-by-step flow of how the application handles an update to the Lot Attribute Dffs:

1. **Incoming Request:**  
   A client sends a PATCH request to update a lotâ€™s attribute Dffs, including the lot identifier and update details.

2. **Controller Reception:**  
   The controller receives the request, verifies the input, and logs that an update request has been initiated.

3. **Delegation to Service Layer:**  
   The controller passes the lot number and update information to the service layer, which is responsible for handling the business logic.

4. **Service Processing & Logging:**  
   In the service layer, the request details are logged for tracking. Depending on the context, the service either:
   - Directly calls a client to perform the update, or  
   - Uses a decorated approach to add extra processing such as logging or additional validation.

5. **Making the Update Call:**  
   The service builds a PATCH request (using a reactive WebClient):
   - It attaches the necessary authentication (from the application context).
   - It constructs the target URI using the provided lot number.
   - It sends the update data (payload) to the backend service.

6. **Error Handling:**  
   If the backend returns an error (client or server error), the service converts the error into a meaningful exception. If the update is successful, it logs the response.

7. **Response Construction:**  
   The successful update result is wrapped in a response structure (HTTP status and updated data) and sent back to the client.

8. **Alternate Flow (if required):**  
   In some cases, the system performs additional steps:
   - It first retrieves related inventory and attribute details.
   - It uses this information to determine the exact record that needs to be updated.
   - Then, it proceeds with the patch operation as described above.

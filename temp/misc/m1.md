### Performance Improvements in the Updated Code

- **Added Elapsed Time Measurement**: The updated code now captures the time taken for the API call using `System.currentTimeMillis()`. This provides visibility into how long each request takes, allowing you to identify and optimize slow parts of the code.

- **Reduced Redundant Mapping**: The previous version of the code used `.map(response -> ...)` followed by additional processing. In the updated version, a `Mono.just()` with `Arrays.stream()` and `.map()` was used for immediate conversion, which can reduce the overall processing time for mapping responses.

- **Improved Error Handling with Timing Information**: The updated code logs the time elapsed whenever an error occurs (`.doOnError`). This helps to diagnose performance issues specifically related to failed API calls, enabling quicker identification of problems.

- **Consolidated Error Logging**: Instead of having multiple scattered log messages, the new code uses `.doOnError()` to log errors, including the time taken before the error occurred. This reduces the number of logging operations and makes the error-handling flow more efficient.

- **Early Return on Error Conditions**: By directly using `Mono.error(...)` and `return` within conditional checks, the updated code reduces further unnecessary processing when an error is detected, allowing for faster error resolution and system stability.

- **Code Clarity and Maintainability**: The updated code has a more structured flow, making it easier to maintain. The logging statements are better organized and provide more meaningful context (such as logging the response status code and detailed error messages), reducing the debugging time.

### Summary
These improvements focus on reducing the processing time per request, increasing visibility into performance bottlenecks, and enhancing error diagnostics. These changes will help in identifying slow operations and ultimately lead to better application performance by ensuring each part of the code executes efficiently.

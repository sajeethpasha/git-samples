## Flow for `batchWorkOrders` API Endpoint

1. **API Request Handling**
   - `@GetMapping("/batchWorkOrders")` endpoint receives a GET request with optional parameters: `organizationCode`, `workOrderGroupNumberSearch`, and `partialLotFlag`.
   - These parameters are used to call the `getBatchWorkDetails` method from `workOrderService`.

2. **Service Layer: getBatchWorkDetails Method**
   - Method `getBatchWorkDetails` takes `organizationCode`, `workOrderNumber`, and `partialLotFlag` as inputs.
   - Logs the start of the processing.
   - Calls `client.getGroupNumberDetails` to retrieve work orders associated with the group number.
     - **Scenario 1: Grouped Batch**
       - The response is flattened to `Flux<WorkOrder>` and filtered by matching the group number.
       - The filtered list is sorted and passed to `generateLotForGroupedBatch` for lot generation if it is not empty.
     - **Scenario 2: Non-Grouped Batch**
       - If the list is empty, it calls `generateLotForNonGroupedBatch` for lot generation.
   - Handles errors by logging and propagating exceptions.

3. **Lot Generation for Grouped Batch: generateLotForGroupedBatch**
   - Retrieves site code details for the given `organizationCode` using `siteCodesRepository`.
   - If no site code details are found, an exception is thrown.
   - For each work order in the sorted list, `itemService.checkItemType` is called to verify item details.
   - If no lot numbers are generated, an exception is thrown.
   - Returns the generated lot numbers.

4. **Lot Generation for Non-Grouped Batch: generateLotForNonGroupedBatch**
   - Retrieves site code details for the given `organizationCode`.
   - If no site code details are found, an exception is thrown.
   - Calls `client.getListWorkOrders` to retrieve the work order details.
   - Filters the work orders to match the given `workOrderNumber` and checks item type using `itemService.checkItemType`.
   - Returns the generated lot numbers or raises an exception if no lot numbers are generated.

5. **Client Call: getListWorkOrders**
   - Fetches work order details using an API call.
   - If the `AzureToken` is available, uses it for the request. Otherwise, falls back to default headers and URLs.
   - Parses the response and returns an array of `WorkOrder` objects.

6. **Item Type Check: checkItemType**
   - Calls an API to list items associated with a work order to verify item type.
   - If no items are found, an exception is thrown.
   - For valid items, calls `validateAndProcessLotNumbers` for further processing.

7. **Lot Number Validation and Processing: validateAndProcessLotNumbers**
   - Logs the item details and proceeds to validate for duplicates or validate work order records.
   - For each item, calculates the lot expiration date and generates a lot number.
   - Checks the existence of an ingredient table and, based on the result, either posts the lot number or calculates an expiration date before posting.

8. **Posting and Saving Lot Details: postAndSaveLotDetails**
   - Depending on the lot control value and preassign flag, saves the lot details to the database.
   - If the lot is successfully saved, posts it to the required systems.
   - Returns a `LotNumber` object with the generated lot information.

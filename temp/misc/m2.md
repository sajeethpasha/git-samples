# Performance Improvements Summary

### Performance Improvements in Bullet Points:

1. **Avoidance of Stream Overhead**:
   - Removed the use of `Arrays.stream()` to count elements in the response array.
   - Directly checking the array length (`responseArray.length > 0`) is **faster** and avoids the **overhead** of stream creation and iteration.

2. **Simplified Control Flow**:
   - The new version has a **simpler and more direct** approach to checking and returning the response.
   - Fewer intermediate operations lead to **lower processing time** and **reduced complexity**.

3. **Reduced Object Creation**:
   - The old version used streams which led to **intermediate object creation**.
   - By eliminating the stream usage, the new code **reduces memory consumption** and minimizes **garbage collection pressure**.

4. **Lower Memory Footprint**:
   - Fewer temporary objects and simplified handling reduce **memory usage**.
   - This is beneficial for **high-throughput scenarios**, where repeated creation of temporary objects can increase the load on the garbage collector.

5. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - The new code explicitly handles empty responses using `Mono.error(new RuntimeException(...))`, which results in **clearer error flow**.
   - The specific error handling path makes it easier to understand and debug, contributing to **better code maintainability**.

6. **Faster Response Processing**:
   - The direct length check is an **O(1)** operation, while the stream-based counting was **O(n)**, leading to significant performance gains, especially for larger arrays.

7. **Reduced Resource Usage**:
   - **CPU usage** is reduced by avoiding unnecessary stream operations.
   - **Memory usage** is minimized due to fewer intermediate data structures.

8. **Scalability**:
   - The reduction in computational overhead and memory usage makes the new version more **scalable**, especially under **high load conditions**.

These improvements make the new code more efficient, reduce the complexity of operations, and provide better performance and resource management without sacrificing functionality.

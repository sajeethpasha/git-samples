# HeroCarousel Module Testing Guide

This document explains the feature file for testing the HeroCarousel module on the HomePage. The file is written in **Gherkin syntax**, commonly used with Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) frameworks like **Cucumber** or **Karate**.

## Structure Overview
- **Feature**: Describes what is being tested (in this case, the "HeroCarousel module").
- **Scenario Outline and Scenarios**: Each scenario represents a specific test case, with given conditions and expected outcomes.
- **Background**: Shared setup steps for all scenarios, such as configuring headers or defining a request body.
- **Steps (Given, When, Then)**: Plain language commands that correspond to executable code within the BDD framework.

## Key Components
### Background
This section contains shared setup steps that apply to all scenarios:
- **Configure Headers**:
  ```gherkin
  * configure headers = read('resources/feature/headers/featureHeaders.json')
  ```
  Configures the request headers from a JSON file (likely to include authorization tokens or content type settings).

- **Define Request Body**:
  ```gherkin
  * def body = read('resources/feature/requestBody/featureCarousel_request.json')
  ```
  Defines the request body by loading a JSON template for the HeroCarousel API request.

### Scenario Categories
- **Positive Scenarios**: Tests for validating successful responses (e.g., `status 200`) or specific conditions like non-empty data.
- **Negative Scenarios**: Tests to validate error handling when the API receives invalid or incomplete input.

## Steps in Detail
### Positive Scenario: Response Follows Contract
```gherkin
Scenario: 200 should be returned when the structure of the response follows the contract
    Given url baseUrl + apiUrl
    And request body
    When method POST
    Then print response
    And status 200
    And match response.data | contains 'jsonObject'
    And match response.data.contentLayout | contains {...}
```
1. **Setup**:
   - Constructs the full API URL by concatenating the `baseUrl` with a specific `apiUrl`.
   - Indicates that the defined request body (`body`) will be sent.
2. **Execution**:
   - Executes an HTTP `POST` request.
3. **Validation**:
   - Prints the API response.
   - Asserts that the response status is `200`.
   - Validates the response structure with `match` statements to ensure compliance with the expected data contract.

### Positive Scenario: Empty Products List
```gherkin
Scenario: An empty list of products should be returned when valid cid is provided and no recommendations are received from Algonomy
    Given url baseUrl + apiUrl
    And request body
    * body.modules.configs.home_page_members = ''
    When method POST
    Then status 200
    Then response.itemsCarousel.products == []
```
This scenario tests behavior when valid input returns an empty products list:
- Modifies `body.modules.configs.home_page_members` to simulate a condition where no recommendations are requested.
- Validates that `products` is either an empty list (`[]`).

### Negative Scenario: Empty Modules
```gherkin
Scenario: An empty list of modules should be returned when invalid cid is provided in the request
    Given url baseUrl + apiUrl
    When method POST
    Then status 200
    Then print response
    Then response.data.contentLayout.modules == []
```
This tests the API response when invalid or incomplete input is provided:
- Sets `modules` in the request body to `null`.
- Ensures that the API returns `400` status, indicating a client error.
- Checks the error message for clarity.

### Other Negative Scenarios
Similar patterns test different failure cases:
- **Missing Fields like `zone`, `moduleType`, `moduleId`, or `configs`**:
  - Set specific fields in the request to `null`.
  - Validate that the API returns `400` with appropriate error messages.

- **Malformed Request**:
  - Send an invalid or empty request body.
  - Validate that the error message indicates a parsing issue.

## Purpose of This File
The purpose of this feature file is to **test the HeroCarousel moduleâ€™s API** under various scenarios:
1. **Behavior Validation**: Ensures the application behaves as expected when interacting with the HeroCarousel API.
2. **Error Handling Verification**: Confirms that the API provides meaningful error messages when invalid data is sent.
3. **Contract Testing**: Checks that the API response conforms to the specified schema.

## Framework
This feature file is likely written for the **Karate testing framework**, based on the syntax used for JSON manipulation, `match` statements, and variable definitions. Karate is widely used for API testing due to its expressive DSL.

## Summary
This feature file provides a structured way to test the functionality and resilience of the HeroCarousel API. It automates both functional testing (successful API responses) and error testing (handling invalid inputs). This ensures the **reliability**, **adherence to data contracts**, and **robustness** of the API.

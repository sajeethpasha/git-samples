# Update on My Work Status

Hi Rima,

I hope you’re doing well. I wanted to inform you that I will be unavailable tomorrow as I have a ritual to attend in my hometown. Unfortunately, I won’t be able to be online until after Tuesday. Thank you for your understanding and support!

Here’s an update on my work status:

## UI
- Pratham provided a new JSON file, and I have updated the UI data views based on it.
- API integration is pending, and the dropdown functionality needs to be updated.

## Backend
- Since the vulnerability check for the `vcs-auth-service` is a high priority, I had a discussion with Pranitha, who provided some initial details.
- I have cloned the code locally and attempted to set up the environment, but I am encountering a Gradle build failure issue.
- I am currently reviewing the flow to resolve this issue.

Please let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to prioritize.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]

# Work Order Reservation System - Technical Overview

## Executive Summary

This document provides an overview of the Work Order Reservation System's key functionality. The system allows users to view inventory reservations associated with specific work orders, which is crucial for production planning and inventory management.

## System Capabilities

The system provides an API endpoint that:
- Retrieves detailed inventory reservation information for a specific work order
- Shows which materials are reserved for the work order
- Provides details about the reserved items including location, quantity, and lot numbers
- Follows RESTful design principles with clear response codes

## Process Flow

When a user or system requests reservation information:

1. The system receives a work order ID from the client application
2. The system fetches the work order details from the database
3. For each material in the work order, the system checks if there are any reservations
4. If reservations exist, the system retrieves detailed information about those reservations
5. All information is consolidated and returned to the requesting user or system

## Technical Implementation

The implementation follows modern software development practices:
- Uses a RESTful API design pattern
- Implements reactive programming (using Mono/Flux) for asynchronous operations
- Provides detailed error handling and logging
- Communicates with external systems through secure API calls
- Returns standardized response formats

## Error Handling

The system handles several error scenarios:
- Returns a 404 status code if the requested work order is not found
- Provides appropriate error messages if reservations cannot be retrieved
- Logs detailed information for troubleshooting and auditing purposes

## Integration Points

The system integrates with:
- Work order management services
- Inventory management systems
- Item catalog services

## Business Benefits

This functionality enables:
- Real-time visibility of material allocations
- Improved production planning through accurate inventory reservation data
- Enhanced inventory management by tracking reserved materials
- Streamlined operations through system integration

## Future Considerations

Potential enhancements could include:
- Filtering capabilities for reservation data
- Real-time updates when reservations change
- Integration with additional downstream systems
- Performance optimizations for large work orders

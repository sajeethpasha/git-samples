# Improvements Comparison: Old vs. Updated Code

Below is a comparison of the improvements made to the `updateWorkOrder` method.

### Key Improvements in the Updated Code

- **Improved Error Handling**
  - The updated code passes the correct `ApiError` object to the `WorkOrderDomainException`.
  - More detailed and informative logging is included for better debugging and context.

- **Detailed Error Logging**
  - The updated code includes contextual information in the logs, such as HTTP status code and error messages, making it easier to identify the root cause of issues.
  - Uses `String.join(", ", apiError.getErrorMessages())` to ensure all error messages are logged.

- **Centralized Error Handling with `onErrorResume`**
  - Added a centralized error handling mechanism using `onErrorResume`, reducing code repetition and improving error consistency.
  - Differentiates between different types of exceptions (e.g., `WebClientResponseException` vs. other exceptions).

- **Retry Mechanism**
  - Added `.retry(3)` to make the request more resilient to transient server-side issues.
  - This prevents temporary network failures from causing immediate failures, thereby improving reliability.

- **Correct Handling of `ApiError`**
  - The updated code ensures proper creation and population of the `ApiError` object.
  - Extracted error messages are passed to `WorkOrderDomainException` to provide more context.

- **Better Separation of Concerns**
  - The updated code distinguishes between different types of errors (`WebClientResponseException` vs. general `Exception`), allowing for more appropriate handling of each case.
  - Improved structure makes the code easier to read and maintain.

- **Structured Logging and Clear Messaging**
  - Enhanced logging to provide specific details about HTTP status, error body, and general unexpected errors.
  - Clearer and more comprehensive error messages make troubleshooting simpler.

### Summary of Improvements

- **Error Handling**: Properly utilizes `ApiError` and improves error logging.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Added retry logic for better resilience against temporary errors.
- **Logging**: Improved logging to include more context, making debugging easier.
- **Centralized Error Handling**: Implemented a centralized error handling strategy, improving maintainability.
- **Error Message Extraction**: Extracted and passed detailed error messages for more meaningful exceptions.

These changes lead to more robust and maintainable code, making it easier to understand, debug, and enhance system reliability.

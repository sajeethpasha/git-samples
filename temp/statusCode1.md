# Work Order Status Update System: Technical Overview

## Executive Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the Work Order Status Update service, focusing on its capabilities, limitations, and key validation rules. The system allows for batch updates of work order statuses while enforcing important business rules to maintain data integrity.

## System Capabilities

The Work Order Status Update service provides the following capabilities:

- **Batch Updates**: Ability to update the status of multiple work orders in a single operation
- **Validation Rules**: Enforces business rules before allowing status changes
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages when validation fails
- **Lightweight Processing**: Uses optimized methods to handle batch updates efficiently

## Key Business Rules

The system enforces the following business rules:

1. **Volume Limitations**:
   - Cannot release more than 20 work orders at once (status: `ORA_RELEASED`)
   - Cannot unrelease more than 20 work orders at once (status: `ORA_UNRELEASED`)

2. **Validation Sequence**:
   - Validates the total number of work orders first
   - Validates each individual work order status before processing
   - Only proceeds with updates if all validations pass

## Technical Process Flow

1. **Request Handling**:
   - System receives a request with multiple work order IDs and the desired status
   - Request is parsed and prepared for validation

2. **Validation Process**:
   - Validates the number of work orders against business rules
   - Validates each work order's current status is eligible for the requested change
   - Collects any validation errors for comprehensive reporting

3. **Update Process**:
   - If all validations pass, processes each work order update
   - Uses lightweight update methods to optimize performance
   - Returns a success response when all updates complete

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If any validation fails, processing stops and returns error details
   - Comprehensive error messages identify specific issues
   - No partial updates are performed - all or nothing approach

## API Details

- **Endpoint**: PATCH `/statusCode`
- **Parameters**: 
  - `work-order-ids`: Comma-separated list of work order IDs
  - Request body containing the new status code
- **Response Codes**:
  - 201 (Created): All work orders updated successfully
  - 404: Work orders not found
  - Other errors are returned with appropriate messages

## System Limitations

- Cannot process more than 20 work orders for release or unrelease operations
- Requires valid work order IDs (numeric values)
- All work orders must be eligible for the requested status change

## Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Batch processing reduces operational overhead
- **Consistency**: Enforced business rules maintain data integrity
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive validation prevents invalid operations
- **Clarity**: Clear error messages simplify troubleshooting

## Technical Implementation Note

The system uses reactive programming (Mono/Flux) to handle requests asynchronously, providing better performance and resource utilization, especially under high load conditions.

# Global Exception Handling Documentation

## Overview

The **GlobalExceptionHandler** class provides a centralized error handling mechanism for the application. It leverages Spring’s `@ControllerAdvice` annotation to intercept exceptions thrown from the controllers and convert them into a consistent and structured JSON response using the `ApiError` model. This approach ensures that both internal and client-facing components receive meaningful error information while keeping the error-handling logic decoupled from the business logic.

## Purpose

- **Centralized Exception Management:**  
  All exceptions, including both custom application exceptions and generic exceptions, are caught and handled in one place. This prevents duplicated error handling code in individual controllers.

- **Consistent API Responses:**  
  Each error response is returned as a JSON payload with a standardized structure defined by the `ApiError` model. This makes it easier for client applications to parse and display error messages.

- **Enhanced Debugging and Logging:**  
  By capturing specific exception details (such as error messages and relevant request data), developers and support teams can more easily diagnose issues that occur during runtime.

## Exception Handling Flow

1. **Intercepting Exceptions:**  
   The `@ControllerAdvice` annotation along with the `@ExceptionHandler` annotation intercepts exceptions thrown by any controller in the application.

2. **Mapping Exceptions to HTTP Status:**  
   Specific exceptions are mapped to their corresponding HTTP status codes:
   - **404 Not Found:** For exceptions such as `GroupNotFoundException`, `UserRolesNotFoundException`, `HardReservationNotFoundException`, etc.
   - **400 Bad Request:** For exceptions such as `GroupCreationException`, `WorkOrderCreationException`, `InvalidArgumentsException`, etc.
   - **500 Internal Server Error:** Any unhandled exception defaults to an internal server error.

3. **Building the API Error Response:**  
   An `ApiError` object is created and populated with error messages. Additional context—such as request data or object state (serialized to JSON)—is appended to the error messages when applicable.

4. **Returning the Response:**  
   A `ResponseEntity<ApiError>` is returned with the appropriate HTTP status, ensuring that client-side applications receive a structured response that is consistent across different error scenarios.

## Supported Exceptions

The handler covers a broad range of custom exceptions, including but not limited to:

- **Group Exceptions:**  
  - `GroupNotFoundException`
  - `GroupCreationException`
  - `GroupUpdateException`

- **Work Order Exceptions:**  
  - `WorkOrderCreationException`
  - `WorkOrderUpdateException`
  - `WorkOrderMaterialUpdateException`
  - `TransformWorkOrderCreationException`
  - `TransformWorkOrderUpdateException`

- **Inventory and Reservation Exceptions:**  
  - `InventoryTransactionCreationException`
  - `InventoryAutomaticReservationCreationException`
  - `InventoryManualReservationCreationException`
  - `InventoryDomainException`
  - `SubInventoryCodeNotFoundException`
  
- **Item and Material Exceptions:**  
  - `ItemNumberLengthException`
  - `ItemConversionNotFoundException`
  - `MaterialTransactionException`
  - `LotNumberException`
  - `ToItemInfoException`
  
- **Filler Rex Work Order Exceptions:**  
  - `FillerRexWorkOrdersRemovalException`
  - `FillerRexWorkOrdersAdditionException`
  
- **Attachment and ERP Integration Exceptions:**  
  - `AttachmentCreationException`
  - `AttachmentDownloadException`
  - `ErpIntegrationCreationException`
  
- **Additional Exceptions:**  
  - `UserRolesNotFoundException`
  - `HardReservationNotFoundException`
  - `PlantInventoryOrganizationsNotFoundException`
  - Exceptions for listing details (e.g., `ListCloseBatchWorkOrdersNotFoundException`, `ListDispostionIdDetailsNotFoundException`, etc.)
  - `MasterRexInfoException`
  - `CustomerInformationException`

Each exception is mapped to either a 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found), or 500 (Internal Server Error) HTTP status based on the nature of the error.

## Key Implementation Details

- **Object Serialization:**  
  The `TrySerializeObject` method is used to convert request objects into a JSON string. This serialized information is appended to the error message list, aiding debugging without exposing sensitive information directly.

- **Dynamic Error Message Composition:**  
  Depending on the exception, additional context is provided. For example, the `ItemConversionNotFoundException` handler includes both the exception message and the specific item ID that was searched.

- **Fallback Handling:**  
  If an exception does not match any of the specific exception types, a generic handler catches it and returns an internal server error response with the exception message.

## Usage Guidelines

- **For Developers:**  
  When throwing exceptions in the business logic, ensure that they are one of the custom exceptions handled by the GlobalExceptionHandler if a specific HTTP status or additional context is needed. This will guarantee that the client receives a well-formed error response.

- **For Support and Maintenance:**  
  Review the logs and API responses during error scenarios. The structured format provided by the `ApiError` object should help quickly diagnose issues by providing the error messages and relevant request data in the response.

- **Extending Exception Handling:**  
  To support new exception types:
  1. Create a custom exception that extends `Exception`.
  2. Add a new handler method or extend an existing one in the GlobalExceptionHandler.
  3. Map it to the appropriate HTTP status code.
  4. Optionally, serialize additional context as needed.

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust and maintainable strategy for handling exceptions across the application. It ensures consistency in error responses, aids in debugging, and improves the overall resilience of the API. By centralizing the error handling logic, developers can focus on business logic, knowing that exceptions will be managed uniformly.

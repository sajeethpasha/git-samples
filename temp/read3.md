## Overview
This document provides a high-level functional flow overview of the work order reservation process, outlining the key steps involved in fetching, updating, and managing inventory reservations.

## Functional Flow Steps

### 1. Initiating Work Order Listing
- The system retrieves a list of work orders based on user-defined search criteria.
- Relevant work orders are displayed to the user.
- **Code Reference:** `listWorkOrders(WorkOrderQuery query)` initiates the listing of work orders by making a REST API call.

### 2. Viewing Reservations by Work Order ID
- Users can select a specific work order to view associated reservations.
- If reservations exist, details are displayed.
- If no reservations are found, an appropriate message is shown.
- **Code Reference:** `getReservationsByWorkOrder(Long id)` retrieves the reservation details using the provided ID.

### 3. Fetching Inventory Details
- The system automatically retrieves inventory details for materials linked to the work order:
  - Current stock levels
  - Reserved and unreserved quantities
  - Available quantities for reservation and transaction
- **Code Reference:** `fetchOnHandDetailsSoapAPI(WorkOrder workOrder)` processes each material in the work order using iteration and updates relevant inventory fields.

### 4. Checking Material Reservations
- For each material in the work order:
  - The system checks if reservations already exist.
  - If found, relevant data such as subinventory, locator, and lot number is updated.
- **Code Reference:** `checkReservationForMaterial(WorkOrder workOrder, WorkOrderMaterial material)` processes each material to verify and update reservation details.

### 5. Reservation Update Process
- If required, the system updates work order details based on available inventory and reservations.
- Users receive confirmation of successful updates or notifications if adjustments are needed.
- **Code Reference:** `getReservationWithDetails(Long workOrderId)` integrates the entire process, invoking methods like `fetchOnHandDetailsSoapAPI` and `checkReservationForMaterial` iteratively.

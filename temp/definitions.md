# Work Order Update System: Technical Overview

## Executive Summary

This document provides a high-level overview of the Work Order Update service, which enables the modification of existing work orders, including their materials, quantities, and associated recipe definitions. The system incorporates comprehensive validation rules, transaction management, and integration with inventory systems.

## System Capabilities

The Work Order Update service provides the following capabilities:

- **Work Order Modification**: Ability to update existing work orders with new information
- **Recipe Integration**: Links work orders to specific recipe definitions
- **Material Management**: Comprehensive handling of materials associated with work orders
- **Inventory Transaction Integration**: Manages inventory transaction dates and associated data
- **Validation Rules**: Enforces business rules before allowing updates

## Key Business Processes

The system manages several key business processes:

1. **Work Order Definition Updates**:
   - Updates to work orders based on recipe definitions
   - Validation of batch quantities and planned start dates

2. **Material Management**:
   - Addition of new materials to work orders
   - Updating quantities of existing materials
   - Special handling for Master Rex items and Rework materials

3. **Inventory Transaction Handling**:
   - Management of inventory transaction dates (with automatic adjustment)
   - Creation of inventory transactions when material quantities change
   - Reservation management for inventory items

## Technical Process Flow

1. **Request Handling**:
   - System receives update request with work order ID and recipe name
   - Adjusts inventory transaction date (59 seconds earlier than provided)

2. **Validation Process**:
   - Validates work order update parameters against recipe definition
   - Checks batch quantities and planned start dates
   - Collects validation results and determines if processing can continue

3. **Update Processing**:
   - If no materials are included, performs simple work order update
   - If materials are included, processes material updates first, then work order update

4. **Material Processing Logic**:
   - For existing materials:
     - Checks if quantity has changed
     - Updates material quantities in existing operations
     - Special handling for Rework items
   - For new materials:
     - Adds materials to existing operations
     - Special handling for Master Rex items
     - Creates inventory transactions and reservations as needed

5. **Response Generation**:
   - Retrieves updated work order with all details
   - Includes materials, products, and custom fields (DFFs)
   - Adds on-hand quantity information from inventory system

## System Validations

The system enforces the following validations:

1. **Recipe Definition Validation**:
   - Verifies the recipe exists before processing updates
   - Validates parameters against recipe specifications

2. **Batch Quantity Validation**:
   - Ensures batch quantities meet recipe requirements

3. **Date Validation**:
   - Validates planned start dates
   - Properly formats and adjusts inventory transaction dates

## Error Handling

The system provides comprehensive error handling:

- **Domain-Specific Errors**:
  - Work Order errors (not found, invalid updates)
  - Inventory errors (transaction failures)

- **Error Logging**:
  - Detailed logging of error conditions
  - Different handling for different error types

## Integration Points

The Work Order Update system integrates with several other systems:

- **Recipe Management System**:
  - Validates against recipe definitions
  - Ensures work order changes comply with recipe requirements

- **Inventory Management System**:
  - Creates inventory transactions
  - Manages material reservations
  - Retrieves on-hand quantities

- **Material Management System**:
  - Handles special materials (Master Rex, Rework)
  - Manages operation-specific materials

## Benefits

- **Process Integrity**: Ensures all updates follow business rules
- **Material Traceability**: Maintains accurate record of materials and quantities
- **Inventory Accuracy**: Keeps inventory transactions synchronized with work order changes
- **Data Consistency**: Prevents invalid updates through comprehensive validation
- **Special Material Handling**: Provides specialized processing for Master Rex and Rework materials

## Technical Implementation Note

The system uses reactive programming (Mono/Flux) to handle requests asynchronously, providing better performance and resource utilization, especially when processing complex material updates and inventory transactions.
